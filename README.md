BMI Program

This BMI program receives input from the user - name, weight and height details - does basic unit conversions and calculates the BMI. It also offers basic advice to the user based on the BMI result. Subsequent versions will come as GUI programs.

The program is written in Python 3.7 so to execute it the user needs to have the Python interpreter installed on their PC. Once the file is run the user is prompted for information. Nothing else is required.
